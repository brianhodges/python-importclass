# Use Class/Object File (Python)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Python projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted .txt file.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/python-importclass
  cd python-importclass
  python main.py
  ```
*Formatted log.txt file will output to the project root*
